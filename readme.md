Set a language as a fallback for the chosen language (e.g. "Deutsch" as a fallback for "Deutsch (Sie)")

## Description ##

Starting with WordPress 4.3, you can use languages such as "Deutsch (Sie)" (formal German) in your WordPress installation. But if the themes or plugins you are using to not have a
translation file for this language, WordPress would use the default language, usually English, instead. With the help of this plugin, you can set a fallback for your chosen langauge.
Every time a translation file is loded, the plugin will than load the fallback, if a translation for the originally chosen language was not found.

A list of all of my plugins can be found on the [WordPress Plugin page](http://kau-boys.com/wordpress-plugins "WordPress Plugins") on my blog [kau-boys.com](http://kau-boys.com).

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Does this plugin only work with formal German? ###

No. You can choose any fallback language that fits your original language. Think about fallbacks from "Spanish (Mexico)" to "Spanish".

### Do I need to manually install the fallback language? ###

No. The plugin will automatically download the fallback language if it is not already installed.
